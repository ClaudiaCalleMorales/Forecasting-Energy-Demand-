# Energy Demand Forecasting

This project demonstrates a basic energy demand forecasting model using synthetic daily data. The model uses **Exponential Smoothing** to capture trend and seasonality, forecasting energy demand for the next 14 days.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

## Highlights
- Generated mock time series data with trend, seasonality, and noise
- Applied Holt-Winters exponential smoothing for short-term forecasting
- Visualized historical data alongside forecast output

This project showcases how time series models can be applied in the context of electricity demandâ€”an important aspect of managing and optimising smart grid systems.
